## a beginners journey into the world of coding

### it's started, let's see where where it will take me ...

I remember sitting in front of a ZX 81 for hours typing in code from a magazine - only for code never to run. Never did I imagine, quite a number of years later, that I would return to coding - but here I am learning Python!!

My background is fairly broad, with a first degree in economics, a masters degrees in both transport logistics, and public health. I currently work in the education and training sector. *I have a strong interest in supporting young people to challenge themselves and be ambitious about their futures self.*

While somethings come easy there's a lot I find challenging but it's great when someting clicks. Over time I hope to be able to contribute to this community. That's my polite way of saying there's not much here ... not yet.

- ğŸ’» and YES, my first line of code was pretty much "Hello World!"
- ğŸ˜€ I like to crochet, code, read, and draw in my free time.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the mighty boosh!
